gradle-compatibility-doc-plugin
====================================
This plugin provides support for `generateCompatibilitySite` DSL in your gradle build files. Using maven dependency strings, you can quickly define what ranges of target libraries are supported by the agent's builtin instrumentation.

:warning: This plugin has a very niche use case for the New Relic Java Agent. 
It is not intended to be used or modified for any other environment.

Open source license
====================================

This project is distributed under the Apache 2 license.

What do you need to make this work?
====================================

Required: 
* Gradle, minimum 5.6

Start using the plugin
====================================

To use the plugin, update your buildscript dependencies in settings.gradle:

```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
      mavenCentral()
      gradlePluginPortal()
    }
  }
```

And reference it in `build.gradle`:

```gradle
buildscript {
    dependencies {
        classpath "com.newrelic.agent.java:gradle-compatibility-doc-plugin:1.1"
    }
}

apply plugin "com.newrelic.gradle-compatibility-doc-plugin"
```

Or simply:

```gradle
 plugins {
   id("com.newrelic.gradle-compatibility-doc-plugin") version "1.1"
 }
```

**Note** For instrumentation bundled with the New Relic Java agent, this is already configured and these steps are not required.

Configuring the plugin
====================================

```gradle
site {
    title 'Anorm'
    type 'Datastore'
    versionOverride '[1.0,)'
}
```

Note: `versionOverride` is optional, otherwise the versions are picked up from the `verifyInstrumentation` block in the instrumentation gradle file.

### Type options:
* 'Datastore'
* 'Framework'
* 'Appserver'
* 'Messaging'
* 'Other'

Running the plugin
====================================

Run the plugin with the generateCompatibilitySite task.

To generate an html page including all instrumentation:

```bash
.../java_agent/$ ./gradlew generateCompatibilitySite
```

Development
====================================

To test the plugin locally, first publish it to your local repository of Maven.
  
After cloning, run the following command in the root of this project:
 
 ```bash
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal
 ```
  

Then update your buildscript dependencies in settings.gradle:

```gradle
pluginManagement {
    repositories {
      mavenLocal()
      mavenCentral()
      gradlePluginPortal()
    }
  }
```

This should pick up your local version of the plugin.
